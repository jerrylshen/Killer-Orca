# Killer-Orca
LA Hack 2018 Project: Used Unity and LeapMotion to create a game where user controls the Killer Whale using hand motion to eat fishes in a 2-person team
  
Moving the hand up makes the orca go up, hand down makes the orca do down, etc
Hand moving forward accelerates, hand moving backward decelerates.
Health continiously goes down, but eating fishes regains life.

Killer-Prca.zip should contain all the assets/files.
